   cd /server
   ```

2. Install dependencies using npm:

## Deployment

### Front End (Netlify)

For continuous deployment of the front end, we use the [Netlify Continuous Deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/#basic-build-settings) solution.

### Web Server (Heroku)

For deploying the web server we use [Heroku Deployment](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs).
